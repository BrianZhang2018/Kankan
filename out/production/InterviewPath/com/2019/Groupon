encapsulation:
refers to bundling the data (e.g. of an object) with the operations on that data. So you have a class encapsulating data - fields - along with the methods for manipulating that data.
Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class.

data-hiding: As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding. like put fields with private modifier.

Inheritance refers to using the structure and behavior of a super class in a subclass.

Polymorphism refers to changing the behavior of a super class in the subclass.
