Another explanation for why both

1. if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1] && !used[i - 1]) continue;
and

2. if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1] && used[i - 1]) continue;
work is given below:

The problem for Permutation II is that different orders of duplicates should only be considered
as one permutation. In other words, you should make sure that when these duplicates are selected,
there has to be one fixed order.

Now take a look at  1  and 2.

Code 1 makes sure when duplicates are selected, the order is ascending (index from small to large).
However, code 2 means the descending order.
