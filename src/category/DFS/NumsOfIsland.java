/*Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water 
and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid 
are all surrounded by water.

Solution: Use the DFS algorithm to find all reachable nodes even in the different level in the graph.
