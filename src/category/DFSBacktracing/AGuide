dfs backtracking:

1. firstly, determine the valid directions, e.g. some question can be four directions, some just move right and down (two directions), this question is three directions

2. recursive dfs+backtracking

3. use the visited to avoid the duplicate visit


backtracking features：

1. visited[] to record the visited place
2. memo[] 相当于DP，减少重复计算
3. reset the value for backTracking
e.g.  temp.add(nums[i]);
      ...
      temp.remove(temp.size() - 1);
