Remember you can use Deque replace Stack.

Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks. This interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class.
When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the beginning of the deque. Stack methods are precisely
equivalent to Deque methods as indicated in the table below:

Stack Method	Equivalent Deque Method
push(e)	            addFirst(e)
pop()	            removeFirst()
peek()	            peekFirst()
