Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for
finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

Graph problem: Single source all destinations shortest paths

Answer: the "longest" shortest path is the least time to access all nodes
