1. int[]: bucket array to store the frequency of character (or Map, but intp[] is better)

2. counter (HashSet): record the number of character and notify to slide the window 

3. two pointer: left, right. min Or maxLen variable.

4. add the character into the freq[] and increase or decrease the couter

5. slide the window. Remove the element from the start of window, and increae the start by add 1 everytime
