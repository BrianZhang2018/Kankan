Time complexity:

Recursion and interative has the same big(O) - time complexity, but recursion is more costly for the memory as need store into the stack.

In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals are Depth-First traversals for Binary Tree (it's also a graph)
O(n), because you traverse each node once. Or rather - the amount of work you do for each node is constant (does not depend on the rest of the nodes).

bigO will be O(n) for unbalanced Binary Tree and O(logn) for balanced BST.
