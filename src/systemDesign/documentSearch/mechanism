1. Use mapReduce program to generate the inverted index and store into the DB

e.g.

Word1 [file1→count of the word1 in file1, file2→count of the word1 in file2 ………]

Word2 [file1→count of the word2 in file1, file2→count of the word2 in file2 ………]

2. Query the DB when user search a document,
   a. Got the words
   b. Compare the position of words which should be the same with the user's search sentence

Inverted index is index data structure for storing mapping results from content, such as words or numbers,
to its locations in a database file or in a document or a set of documents. Most of the text searching systems
rely on inverted index to search the documents that contains a given word or a term.
