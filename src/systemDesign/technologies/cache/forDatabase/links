Microservice -> Cache, e.g. cache-refresh-ahead-spring-boot-starter

Cache Aside:
Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading. Only requested data is cached,
which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.

Data can become stale if it is updated in the database.
This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.

The application only request data from the cache. If a ‘cache miss’ occurs, the cache is responsible to retrieve data from the database,
update itself and return data to the application.
Client don't interact with DB which take care by the cache provider like redis, but cache-aside need do db update itself.
