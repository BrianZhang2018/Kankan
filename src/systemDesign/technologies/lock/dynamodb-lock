Optimistic locking with version number:
With optimistic locking, each item has an attribute that acts as a version number.

Conditional Write:
Conditional writes are helpful in cases where multiple users attempt to modify the same item.
Conditional writes can be idempotent if the conditional check is on the same attribute that is being updated.
