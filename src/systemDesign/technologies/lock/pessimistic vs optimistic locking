Pessimistic Locking:
Because both Alice and Bob hold the read (shared) lock on the account record with the identifier value of 1,
neither of them can change it until one releases the read lock they acquired.
This is because a write operation requires a write (exclusive) lock acquisition,
and read (shared) locks prevent write (exclusive) locks.

Optimistic Locking:
Optimistic Locking allows a conflict to occur, but it needs to detect it at write time.

The version column is going to be incremented every time an UPDATE or DELETE statement is executed w
hile also being used for matching the expected row snapshot in the WHERE clause.
