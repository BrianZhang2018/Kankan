1. decouple the file(image ...) upload service from main API
2. signed upload/download url
3. manage request lifecycle

    Step 1: Client request an upload URL from the server (REQUEST)
    Step 2: Client uploads the image data to the upload URL (UPLOAD)
    Step 3: Client tells the server the upload is completed (CONFIRM)

    Step 5: Client checks image processing status (CHECK)
    Step 6: Server is done processing image, notifies client (FINALIZE)
