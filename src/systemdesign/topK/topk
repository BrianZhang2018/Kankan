Single host - topK algorithm (priorityQueue) - not scalable

multiple host - Count min sketch - two dimensions table + N hash functions


accuracy:

We have observed that the Count-min sketch is a good choice in a situation where we have to process a large data set with
low memory consumption. We also saw that the more accurate result we want the number of hash functions(rows/width) has to
be increased.
